      "explanation": "Section 24(5) PACE sets out the necessity criteria for arrest. One key ground is enabling prompt and effective investigation. Mere suspicion of guilt, convenience, or punitive intent are not valid necessity grounds.",

      "explanation": "While client confidentiality is paramount, you cannot assist with ongoing or future criminal conduct. You should clearly advise the client that such conduct is illegal, that you cannot assist, and may need to withdraw if they persist.
