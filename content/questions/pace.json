      "correct": "C",
      "explanation": "PACE s.24 requires that arrest is necessary. One necessity ground is where the person's name or address cannot be readily ascertained (or is doubted). Arrest is not automatic for offence type; necessity must be justified.",

        { "id": "D", "text": "PACE 1984 s.58" }
      ],
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "PACE includes a duty to inform the person they are under arrest and the grounds for arrest. This is central to the lawfulness of arrest and subsequent detention. (In practice you would check the custody record and officer notes for what was said and when.)",

      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Time limits and review points are calculated from the relevant time (as defined in PACE). Getting this wrong can lead to unlawful over‑detention going unnoticed. As a PSR, you should confirm the relevant time from the custody record and cross-check any delays.",
