# Supabase Project Status - Active ✅

Your Supabase project appears to be active and running!

## What I Can See:
- ✅ Project Status: **Active** (green indicator)
- ✅ Tables: **15** (migrations appear to be successful)
- ✅ Project is on the **NANO** plan (free tier)
- ✅ Database is ready

## Next Steps:

1. **Try Logging In Again**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/login
   - Enter your credentials
   - The "Failed to fetch" error should be resolved now

2. **If Login Still Fails:**
   - Hard refresh your browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser console (F12) for any errors

3. **Verify Database Tables:**
   - In Supabase dashboard, click on "Tables" in the left sidebar
   - You should see all 15 tables from your migrations

4. **Check Authentication Settings:**
   - Go to: Authentication → Settings
   - Verify Site URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Verify Redirect URLs include: `http://localhost:3000/**`
